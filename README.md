# DeepLearning
Practical notebooks from Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016)

These were created for my own personal learning and are largely summarizations and practical implementations of sections of ['Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) which I found too difficult to follow without hands-on implementation. I have left this repository public in case any other learners stumble upon these and find my rewordings or (at times) more detailed solutions useful for their own sake.
